# Emacs

My Emacs config, requires [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs). 

I split it out from my [grab bag of config](https://github.com/lglenn/Config.git), see that repo for earlier history -- note to future self, if I decide to give up on Doom and go back to vanilla emacs, that's where the split happened.
